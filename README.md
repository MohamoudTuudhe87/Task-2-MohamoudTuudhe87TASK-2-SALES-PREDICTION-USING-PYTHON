# SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales based on different advertising expenditures. By analyzing the relationship between the money spent on TV, radio, and newspaper advertising and the resulting sales, we can develop a predictive model to optimize marketing budgets.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts sales using various advertising channels as input features. The project demonstrates the application of linear regression in understanding and predicting sales trends.

## Description
This project involves the following steps:

**Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project includes advertising expenditures on TV, radio, and newspapers along with corresponding sales figures.  
**Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables.   
**Data Preprocessing**: Handle any missing values, and prepare the data for modeling.   
**Model Development**: Implement a linear regression model to predict sales based on the advertising budget.   
**Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
## Steps
**1. Import Libraries**: Load the necessary Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.   
**2. Load Data**: Import the dataset and perform initial data inspection.   
**3. Data Visualization**: Use scatter plots and pair plots to visualize relationships between features and sales.   
**4. Modeling**: Develop and train the linear regression model.   
**5. Evaluation**: Visualize and interpret the model's predictions and accuracy.   

## Tools and Libraries
**Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and model development.   
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.   
**Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
**Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and figures.   
**Scikit-learn**: For implementing the linear regression model.   

## Visualization

**Pairplot**: Visualizing the pairwise relationships between features.   
**Scatter Plot**: Displaying the relationship between two continuous variables.    
**Regression Plot**: Visualizing the linear relationship between variables with a fitted regression line.   
**Heatmap**: Displaying the correlation between variables.  
**Boxplot**: Showing the distribution of numerical data.
